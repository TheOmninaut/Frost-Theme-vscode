NOT COMPLETE or ready for distribution, this is more of a personal placeholder until i finish the theme. 

The goal and general feel of this theme is to have a more contrasting, darker, and intense version of NORD. Not intended as a replacement however. i find nord to be great for general computing as its relaxing and comfortable, but for tasks that require focus and discerning elements (like coding) some more intense colors function better.

Installation:
again, this isnt finished or ready so if you want to install this now, its a bit of a workaround but should still work.

1) follow the first three steps here: https://themes.vscode.one/faq/publishing-theme
for step 3 use the theme json file included here

2) place the whole folder with the new edited json file in the extensions folder for vscode. (in reg vs code its in C:\Users\<user>\.vscode\extensions for codium its <CodiumDirectory>\resources\app\extensions
  
3) restart codium and choose change theme color from preferences

4) for custom bracket colors and some settings that i use, just copy the profile settings file into your user profile settings
(CTRL + SHIFT + P, then search settings and choose user settings file)
