NOT COMPLETE or ready for distribution, this is more of a personal placeholder until i finish the theme. 


Installation:
again, this isnt finished or ready so if you want to install this now, its a bit of a workaround but should still work.

1) follow the first three steps here: https://themes.vscode.one/faq/publishing-theme
for step 3 use the theme json file included here

2) for custom bracket colors and some settings that i use, just copy the profile settings file into your user profile settings
(CTRL + SHIFT + P, then search settings and choose user settings file)
